# Student Performance Analysis Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using Python and data analysis techniques.  
The main objective is to understand performance trends and identify factors that affect student results, such as study hours and part-time job status.

The analysis helps in identifying weak subjects, overall pass/fail ratio, and behavior patterns that influence academic outcomes.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains approximately **9000 student records**
- Includes both academic and behavioral attributes

### Key Features:
- Gender
- Study_Hours
- Part_Time_Job
- Math, Physics, Chemistry marks
- Course Recommendation and Rating

The dataset was cleaned by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and creating new useful features.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Microsoft Excel (for initial dataset handling)

---

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing
The following steps were performed:
- Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., phone numbers, names)
- Handled missing and duplicate values
- Calculated **Average Marks**
- Created **Result (Pass/Fail)** column
- Assigned **Final Grades** based on performance

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Subject-wise average marks analysis
- Pass vs Fail distribution
- Study hours vs performance analysis
- Impact of part-time job on academic performance
- Gender-wise performance comparison
- Identification of most difficult subject

Graphs such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts were used for better visualization and understanding.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Students with higher study hours generally perform better.
- Students without part-time jobs tend to have slightly higher average scores.
- Physics was identified as the most challenging subject based on average marks.
- Clear performance patterns were observed using visual analysis.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to extract meaningful insights from educational data.  
The results can help educational institutions and students take informed decisions to improve academic performance.
